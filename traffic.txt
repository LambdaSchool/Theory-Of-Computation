In this diagram I demonstrate with 6 examples three situations and states that
the traffic lights must at a minimum respect.

One and two represent priority being given to the non-intersecting traffic lanes
with the highest combined weight.

Three and four demonstrate the blocking and waiting that must occur for the lesser
of the two axis's combined weight.

Five and six point out an important proceedure for managing left turns. After weigh-in,
and before the winning axis gets to move forward. First allow the winning axis a left turn
on both respective sides.

Weighing, left turn phase, straight traffic phase, reevaluate that when the weight of the
losing axis has exceeded the now reduced competing axis it we allow the cycle to restart.

Heavy traffic and light on one side means that we must either toggle axis direction and only
effect the wait time or the presedence of any registered weight should que a turn for green.
