## Exercises

* Where do you see boolean algebra used in JavaScript?
> You would find it in code where you would need to make comparisons
> and conditional statments.  Logical breaks and code flow relies heavily
> on being able to know if two things compare or not in a truethy way.
> Basically anytime you are comparing two items without mathematical
> comparison, but using boolean results as an output from the comparison.

* What are some examples of logical symbols in JavaScript?
> `< > <= >=`, `! !=`, `&& ||`

* The Analytical Engine was never constructed. Why not?
> Because of being unable to secure funds to complete the machine, which
> Seemed to be a common problem among his varying inventions. One reason
> which may have compounded this was the disagreements and difficulties
> that he had with communicating with and aquiring parts from his
> varying contractors. This was primarily due to changing requirements and
> requiring such precision and uniformity, more than standard equipment
> and training was normally required to produce consistently.
